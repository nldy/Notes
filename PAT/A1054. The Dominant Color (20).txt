Behind the scenes in the computer's memory, color is always talked about as a series of 24 bits of information for each pixel. In an image, the color with the largest proportional area is called the dominant color. A strictly dominant color takes more than half of the total area. Now given an image of resolution M by N (for example, 800x600), you are supposed to point out the strictly dominant color.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 positive numbers: M (<=800) and N (<=600) which are the resolutions of the image. Then N lines follow, each contains M digital colors in the range [0, 224). It is guaranteed that the strictly dominant color exists for each input image. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

Output Specification:

For each test case, simply print the dominant color in a line.

Sample Input:
5 3
0 0 255 16777215 24
24 24 0 0 24
24 0 24 24 24
Sample Output:
24

思路：使用map映射

#include<cstdio>
//#include<cstring>
//#include<vector>
//#include<set>
#include<map>
//#include<iostream>
//#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int n, m;
	scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
	map<int, int> count;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
		for (int j = 0; j < m; j++){
			int num;
			scanf("%d", &num);
			if (count.find(num) != count.end())
				count[num]++;
			else
				count[num] = 1;
		}
	}
	int k = 0 , max = 0;
	for (map<int, int>::iterator it = count.begin(); it != count.end(); it++){
		if (it->second > max)
		{
			k = it->first;//获取第一个关键字
			max = it->second;//获取第二个关键字
		}
	}
	printf("%d\n", k);
	return 0;
}
