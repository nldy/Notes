If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you would know the world of magic has its own currency system -- as Hagrid explained it to Harry, "Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough." Your job is to write a program to compute A+B where A and B are given in the standard form of "Galleon.Sickle.Knut" (Galleon is an integer in [0, 107], Sickle is an integer in [0, 17), and Knut is an integer in [0, 29)).

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line with A and B in the standard form, separated by one space.

Output Specification:

For each test case you should output the sum of A and B in one line, with the same format as the input.

Sample Input:
3.2.1 10.16.27
Sample Output:
14.1.28

注意：要使用long long ，有些数据很大

#include<cstdio>
int g = 29 * 17;
int s = 29;
int main()
{
	long long num1[3], num2[3];
	long long mon1, mon2, mon;
	scanf("%lld.%lld.%lld %lld.%lld.%lld", &num1[0], &num1[1], &num1[2], &num2[0], &num2[1], &num2[2]);
	mon1 = num1[0] * g + num1[1] * s + num1[2];
	mon2 = num2[0] * g + num2[1] * s + num2[2];
	mon = mon1 + mon2;
	printf("%lld.%lld.%lld", mon / g, mon%g / s, mon%s);
	return 0;
