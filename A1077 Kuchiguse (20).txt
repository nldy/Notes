题目描述
The Japanese language is notorious for its sentence ending particles. Personal preference of such particles can be considered as a reflection of the speaker's personality. Such a preference is called "Kuchiguse" and is often exaggerated artistically in Anime and Manga. For example, the artificial sentence ending particle "nyan~" is often used as a stereotype for characters with a cat-like personality:
Itai nyan~ (It hurts, nyan~)
Ninjin wa iyada nyan~ (I hate carrots, nyan~)

Now given a few lines spoken by the same character, can you find her Kuchiguse?

输入描述:
Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line is an integer N (2<=N<=100). Following are N file lines of 0~256 (inclusive) characters in length, each representing a character's spoken line. The spoken lines are case sensitive.


输出描述:
For each test case, print in one line the kuchiguse of the character, i.e., the longest common suffix of all N lines. If there is no such suffix, write "nai".

输入例子:
3
Itai nyan~
Ninjin wa iyadanyan~
uhhh nyan~

输出例子:
nyan~

思路：字符串反转后开始从下标0比较
注意：最小长度的字符串的长度为结束比较的位置，要得到最小长度，定义一个记录变量，在输入一个字符串时就进行比较


#include<cstdio>
#include<cstring>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;
int minlen = 256;
char speak[100][260];
int main()
{
	int n,count=0;
	scanf("%d", &n);
	getchar();
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
		gets(speak[i]);
		int len = strlen(speak[i]);
		if (len < minlen)
			minlen = len;
		reverse(speak[i], speak[i] + len);
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < minlen; i++){
		char ch = speak[0][i];
		bool same = true;
		for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
			if (ch != speak[j][i]){
				same = false;
				break;
			}
		}
		if (same == true)
			count++;
		else
			break;
	}
	if (count == 0)
		printf("nai");
	else{
		for (int i = count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
			printf("%c", speak[0][i]);
	}
	return 0;
}
