Being unique is so important to people on Mars that even their lottery is designed in a unique way（只出现一次）.  The rule of winning is simple: one bets on a number chosen from [1, 104].  The first one who bets on a unique number wins.  For example, if there are 7 people betting on 5 31 5 88 67 88 17, then the second one who bets on 31 wins.

输入描述:
Each input file contains one test case.  Each case contains a line which begins with a positive integer N (<=105) and then followed by N bets.  The numbers are separated by a space.


输出描述:
For each test case, print the winning number in a line.  If there is no winner, print "None" instead.

输入例子:
7 5 31 5 88 67 88 17

输出例子:
31

//using namespace std;
const int maxn = 100010;
int pe[maxn];
int num[10010] = { 0 };
int main()
{
	int n;
	scanf("%d", &n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
		scanf("%d",&pe[i]);
		num[pe[i]]++;
	}
	int out = -1;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
		if (num[pe[i]] == 1){
			out = pe[i];
			break;
		}
	}
	if (out > -1)
		printf("%d\n", out);
	else
		printf("None\n");
	return 0;
